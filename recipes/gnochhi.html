        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These soft, tender, and sometimes slightly chewy dumplings are cut from a dough that's rolled into ropes, often pressed with a fork to create ridges for sauce to cling to.</p>
        <p>Gnocchi are typically boiled until they float, then served as a first course (primo) with various sauces like pesto, tomato, or a simple butter and sage sauce</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dry potato flakes</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potato flakes in a medium-size bowl. Pour in boiling water; stir until blended. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Stir in egg, salt, and pepper. Blend in enough flour to make a fairly stiff dough. Turn dough out on a well floured board. Knead lightly.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Shape each half into a long thin roll, the thickness of a breadstick. With a knife dipped in flour, cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Place a few gnocchi in boiling water. As the gnocchi rise to the top of the pot, remove them with a slotted spoon. Repeat until all are cooked.</li>
        </ol>
